# That weird game

This game was created to seem playable, but to have rules so obscure and variable, to make it realistically impossible.

It was made to explore [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

# Deployment

This game was made as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) deployable project. After selecting correct project, `npm run build && firebase deploy` should do the trick :)
